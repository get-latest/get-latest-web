# Follow-Up Is Where Deals Go to Die

Not because people don’t care.  
Not because they’re lazy.

Because no one is clearly on the hook.

The deal waits.  
The task lingers.  
The customer assumes you moved on.

## “I Thought Someone Else Had It”

This is the most expensive sentence in business.

It shows up after:
- A missed response
- A stalled deal
- A delayed handoff

Everyone assumed responsibility existed.  
No one could point to it.

## Implied Ownership Fails Under Load

Implied ownership works when:
- Volume is low
- Everyone remembers
- The founder is watching

It breaks when:
- The pipeline fills
- Priorities compete
- People get busy

The system doesn’t collapse loudly.  
It just stops catching things.

---

## Follow-Up Is a Symptom, Not the Cause

When leaders push for “better follow-up,” they’re treating the surface.

The real issue is structural:
- Who owns the next step
- When it must happen
- What happens if it doesn’t

Without those answers, follow-up depends on memory and goodwill.

That doesn’t scale.

---

## Activity Creates False Reassurance

Emails sent.  
Notes logged.  
Tasks created.

All of it looks like progress.

But progress requires movement toward a decision.  
Activity alone doesn’t create that.

Ownership does.

---

## Ownership Changes the Conversation

When ownership is explicit:
- Silence becomes visible
- Stalls trigger action
- Problems surface early

The question shifts from:
“Did anyone follow up?”

To:
“Why didn’t this move when it should have?”

That’s a solvable problem.

---

## A Simple Test

Pick any active deal or task and answer one question:

**Who owns the next step, and by when?**

If that answer isn’t immediate, the system already failed.

Not the person.

---

If follow-up in your business depends on someone remembering, it will keep failing at scale.

Describe one place where ownership is implied instead of enforced.
That’s where control breaks down.
