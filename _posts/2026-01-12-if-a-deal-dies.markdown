# Where the good deals go to die
Most deals don’t get “lost.”

They just stop moving.

No email.  
No next meeting.  
No decision.  
No escalation.

The deal doesn’t explode. It fades.

And when you finally notice, you can’t tell whether it’s dead, delayed, or already replaced by a competitor.

That’s not a sales problem.

That’s a system problem.

## Deals Don’t Die Loudly

A deal can be healthy and still be at risk.

The risk isn’t always objection or pricing.  
The risk is **silence**.

Silence looks like:
- “They’re busy this week.”
- “I’ll follow up tomorrow.”
- “We’re waiting on them.”
- “I thought you handled that.”

Silence is how revenue disappears without a decision.

## The Real Cause: Undefined Ownership + No Trigger for Action

Most teams rely on implied responsibility.

Someone *should* follow up.  
Someone *will* notice.  
Someone *must* be on it.

But implied ownership fails under load.

When the pipeline gets busy, what gets attention is what screams.  
What doesn’t scream gets ignored.

Deals don’t scream.

## Activity Is Not Progress

This is where teams fool themselves.

The CRM has notes.  
Calls happened.  
Emails went out.

But the deal still isn’t moving toward a decision.

Progress has a signature:
- A calendar event
- A decision date
- A commitment
- A next step with an owner

If your pipeline doesn’t force those signals, you’re tracking motion, not momentum.

## Quiet Death Creates Second-Order Problems

The first loss is the deal.

The second loss is what it does to the business:
- Forecast confidence drops
- Sales cycles stretch
- Reps sandbag or inflate
- Leadership starts “managing harder” instead of fixing the failure mode

Then you get the worst of both worlds:
More meetings, less control.

## The Fix Is Not “Better Follow-Up”

Better follow-up is a human discipline solution.

That works until:
- People get busy
- Priorities change
- Someone takes PTO
- A rep leaves
- The volume doubles

Discipline doesn’t scale.

Systems scale.

## What a Working System Prevents

A working system makes quiet failure hard.

It forces clarity:
- Who owns the next step
- When it must happen
- What counts as stalled
- What happens when it stalls

Not as a policy.  
As reality.

## A Simple Test

Pick 10 active deals and answer two questions:

1. **What is the next step?**
2. **Who owns it and by when?**

If you can’t answer those instantly, the deal is already at risk.

Not because your team is bad.

Because your system allows silence.

If deals in your business can go quiet without consequence, you will keep losing revenue without understanding why.

Describe one place where deals stall without anyone noticing.
That’s the fastest place to regain control.
